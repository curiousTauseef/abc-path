abc-path-solve - a solver for ABC Path

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<abc-path-solve> /path/to/board

B<abc-path-solve> --gen-v1-template

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a solver for ABC Path ( L<http://www.brainbashers.com/abcpath.asp> ).

=head1 FORMAT

Sample boards can be found in the distribution under C<t/layouts/> .

Here is the description of their format. The first line should be the
magic string C<ABC Path Solver Layout Version 1:> , and the next line should
be a row of 7 letters, the first being a hint for the top-left-to-bottom-right
perpendicular, the last being a hint for the top-right-to-bottom-left
perpendicular and the rest of the letters being vertical hints.

After that, there are 5 rows of horizontal hints being a letter, 5 spaces
and another letter. On one of the squares one can put a letter instead of a
space, to indicate it must be there.

The last row is another row of vertical hints and perpendicular hints.

Here's an example:

    ABC Path Solver Layout Version 1:

    E     L
    U     F
    Y     P
    R     S

One can also generate a skeleton for such a layout using the
B<--gen-v1-template> flag.
